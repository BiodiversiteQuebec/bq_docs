## Table: Observations

### Description

The `observations` table is central in the Atlas database to recording ecological observations. It is is designed to support different observation types, such as abundances, occurrences, and presence/absence data of various units. The type of observation is specified by the `id_variables` column, which references the `variables` table. See the `variables` table documentation for more details.

It encompasses a wide range of data including geographical coordinates, observation times, taxa details, and associated variables, relying on foreign keys to other tables to store this information. See the `Dependencies` section below for more details and relevant tables documentation.

Partitions are used to store observations that are within or outside of Quebec. This allows for faster queries on observations that are within Quebec, which are the most commonly used. See the `partitions` section below for more details.

Triggers are used to automatically update the `within_quebec`, `modified_at`, `dwc_event_date` columns on insert or update. See the `triggers` section below for more details.

### Additional Constraints

- **Primary Key Constraint**: The combination of `id` and `within_quebec` serves as a unique identifier for each observation record.
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Links to `datasets` and `taxa_obs` tables ensure referential integrity.
- **Unique Constraint**: The combination of `geom`, `dwc_event_date`, `id_taxa_obs`, `obs_value`, `id_variables`, `within_quebec` ensures that each observation is uniquely identifiable and retrievable. This is used to prevent duplicates using the index `observations_unique_rows`.

### Indexes

- `observations_year_obs_idx` on `year_obs`
- Specific indexes on partitions (`within_quebec_year_obs_idx`, `observations_id_taxa_obs_idx` in `observations_partitions.within_quebec`)

### Triggers

- `set_dwc_event_date_trggr`: Before insert, sets the DwC event date.
- `update_modified_at`: Before update, updates the `modified_at` timestamp.
- `action_user_logger`: In partition `observations_partitions.outside_quebec`, logs user actions before insert or update.

### Rationale

#### Use of Partitions for Performance

The use of table partitions in the observations table, particularly with the within_quebec column, is a strategic decision aimed at enhancing database performance. Partitioning is a highly effective method for managing large tables by splitting them into smaller, more manageable pieces. In this case, the observations_partitions schema segregates observation data into distinct partitions based on whether the observations occurred within Quebec (within_quebec = true) or outside it (within_quebec = false). This approach significantly improves query performance by allowing the database engine to quickly locate and retrieve data from a smaller subset of the table. Additionally, it simplifies maintenance tasks such as backups and data purges, as operations can be performed on individual partitions without affecting the entire dataset.

Partition tables `observations_partitions.within_quebec` and `observations_partitions.outside_quebec` are created within the `observations_partitions` schema. 

#### Temporal Columns

The inclusion of year_obs, month_obs, day_obs, and time_obs columns in the observations table is intentionally designed to accommodate observations with varying levels of temporal resolution. This flexibility is crucial in ecological data collection, where the exact time of an observation may range from a specific moment to a broader time frame. By breaking down the observation timestamp into separate components, the database can store and process data that is only accurate to a certain level (e.g., year, month, day, or time). This structure not only caters to the diverse nature of ecological observations but also enhances the ability to perform time-based queries and analyses with varying granularities.

#### Duplicates and DwC Event Date

Duplicates are possible through the process of adding data from various sources, such as GBIF and eBird. Duplicates are limited through the use of a unique constraint on the combination of `geom`, `dwc_event_date`, `id_taxa_obs`, `obs_value`, `id_variables`, `within_quebec`. 

The `dwc_event_date` column values are generated automatically using a trigger function. It is a formatted string that reflects a standardized approach to recording event dates in biodiversity data. The use of this column is required to ensure each observation is distinctly identifiable and retrievable. It also facilitates data interoperability, making it easier to share and compare ecological data across different platforms and studies.

## Table: Taxa_Obs

### Description

The `taxa_obs` table is structured to record raw taxonomic information directly from source data. This table is essential for capturing a wide range of taxonomic details, including scientific names, authorship, and taxonomic rank. It is designed to accommodate taxa of any rank, such as species, genus, complexes, etc., without requiring corrections for grammatical accuracy or valid taxonomy. These aspects are managed by other resources within the database, like the `taxa_ref` table.

### Additional Constraints

- **Unique Constraint**: `taxa_obs_unique_rows` ensures that each combination of `scientific_name`, `authorship`, `rank`, `parent_scientific_name` is unique within the table.

### Indexes

- `taxa_obs_scientific_name_idx` on `scientific_name`

### Triggers

- `update_modified_at`: Before update, updates the `modified_at` timestamp.

### Conflicts and Parent Taxa

The design of the `taxa_obs` table accounts for the potential conflicts in scientific naming. For instance, the same scientific name may correspond to different organisms in separate branches of the tree of life (e.g., `Salix` as a genus of willows in plants and a genus of tunicates in animals). To resolve such conflicts, the `parent_scientific_name` column allows users to specify a parent taxa name, thus restricting results to a specific branch. This feature is particularly useful for accurate data retrieval and association in cases of nomenclatural ambiguity.

## Table: Variables

### Description

The `variables` table in the database is crafted to support a diverse array of observation types and units. This versatility is key to accommodating various ecological data formats, such as counts of individuals, weight, density, occurrences, and presence/absence data, among others. Each of these observation types can be associated with different units of measurement. The table facilitates the recording and categorization of these different types and units, making it a pivotal component for data analysis and interpretation in ecological studies. The `id_variables` column, found in other related tables like `observations`, references the `variables` table to specify the type of observation, providing a clear link to the detailed description and unit of the variable being observed.

<!-- Section efforts and lookup table -->
## Table: Efforts

### Description

The `efforts` table is specifically designed to record the efforts associated with ecological observations. This table plays a crucial role in quantifying and categorizing the effort invested in obtaining various observations. The efforts could be in various forms like time spent, area covered, traps used, etc., and are quantified as numeric values. The link to the `variables` table through `id_variables` specifies the type of effort being recorded, ensuring a standardized and coherent approach to effort recording across different observation types.

#### Relationship with Observations

The efforts table is intricately linked to the observations table through the obs_efforts lookup table. This table acts as a relational bridge, establishing a connection between individual observations and the corresponding efforts involved in their acquisition. The obs_efforts table essentially serves as a many-to-many relationship facilitator, allowing each observation to be associated with one or more effort entries, and vice versa. See the `obs_efforts` table documentation for more details.

## Table: Obs_Efforts

### Description

The `obs_efforts` table serves as a linking mechanism between ecological observations and the efforts associated with them. It is a junction table designed to create a many-to-many relationship, capturing which efforts are related to specific observations. This design is essential for providing a comprehensive understanding of the resources and efforts expended in gathering each observation, such as the time, distance covered, or equipment used. By establishing a clear connection between observations and their corresponding efforts, this table enhances the granularity and context of ecological data analysis.
